### Code Unification & Cleanup
1. Ensure all code is well-commented and follows project conventions. <!-- COMPLETED: Updated code comments and enforced style guidelines. -->
2. Write unit/integration tests for core systems (mob spawning, input handling). <!-- COMPLETED: Added unit tests for TypingInputHandler and MobSpawner. -->
3. Modularize code for easy future expansion (mobs, levels, UI).
4. Keep project layout and documentation up to date.

### Mobs & Extensibility

2. Document the process for adding new mobs (base class, config, registration).
3. Implement a mob registry/factory for dynamic mob instantiation.
4. Add unique behaviors and visuals for each mob type (e.g., armored, shielded, boss).

2. Add world/level progression with unlocks and save/load progression.
3. Create a level editor or config-driven level creation.

### Core Gameplay & Polish

2. Add combo/multiplier system for consecutive correct typings.
3. Create a pause menu and game over screen with stats.
4. Add a tutorial/intro level for new players.

### UI/UX Improvements
1. Polish HUD: show score, combo, health, and level progress.
2. Add animated transitions between scenes and levels.
3. Improve accessibility (color contrast, font size, input remapping).
4. Add sound/music controls.

### Audio & Visuals
1. Add background music and sound effects for actions/events.
2. Enhance mob and background animations.
3. Add particle effects for typing streaks, mob defeat, and level completion.

### Future Features (Optional)
1. Add power-ups or special abilities.
2. Implement multiplayer or leaderboard features.
